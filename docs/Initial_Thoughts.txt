TOPIC SENTENCE: 
“Provide BlueJ users the ability to analyze source code using a suite of code analysis tools.” 

ERIN’S THOUGHTS LEADING INTO THIS MEETING:
Define “suite”
    What is is (just so all stakeholders are on the same page)
    What sort of “tools” are in the suite
    How it’s packaged (mostly for the maintainers)
    How it’s accessed (mostly for the maintainers)

Define “source code”
    What it is (mostly for CS I students)
    Indicate that BlueJ is used to develop this (again, mostly for CS I students)

Indicate analysis is static and dynamic
    Define static – looks at the source code
    Define dynamic – compiles and runs the source code

Define “users”
    Students
    Teachers
    Anyone else likely to use BlueJ? 
        People who write a lot of unit tests, maybe?
        Would professionals use this?

We’re stakeholders, so is there anything that should be there for us?
