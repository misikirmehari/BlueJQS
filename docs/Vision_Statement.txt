DEW: Vision Statement

Provide BlueJ users the ability to analyze source code using a suite of code analysis
tools. Our product (coupled with BlueJ) aims to (use BlueJ) help form a foundation of 
high-quality code practices and industry standards for novice Java programmers to build 
upon (using BlueJ). Students will use BleuJ in conjunction with our software to verify the 
correctness of their code. BlueJ provides a template for students to write sections of 
code in; these are referred to as source code. Our suite is a collection of tools that are 
designed to catch errors in source code. Our aim is to include tools that would be used to 
automate the process of finding and correcting a variety of bugs, flaws, and convention 
errors. These tools may use static analysis, which evaluates the source code text, or 
dynamic analysis, which evaluates the behavior of the code during run-time.
